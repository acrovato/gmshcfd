## Main features
GmshCFD can create tetrahedral CFD meshes around isolated or multiple lifting surfaces suitable for external aerodynamics (potential, Euler or RANS equations). The lifting surfaces can have a sharp or a blunt trailing edge.

## Documentation
Detailed build and use instructions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/acrovato/gmshcfd/wiki).

# GmshCFD
GmshCFD is an open-source Python tool based on [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) for creating CFD meshes around lifting surfaces. It was developed by Adrien Crovato during the year 2023.

## Main features
GmshCFD can create tetrahedral CFD meshes around isolated or multiple lifting surfaces suitable for external aerodynamics (potential, Euler or RANS equations). The lifting surfaces can have a sharp or a blunt trailing edge.

## Documentation
Detailed build and use instructions can be found in the [wiki]https://github.com/acrovato/gmshcfd/wiki).

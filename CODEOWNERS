# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, they
# will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @acrovato

# These owners own a directory and nested subdirectories
#/gmshcfd/ @acrovato

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
